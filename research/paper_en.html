            <p>Ethanol exposure during gestational period is related to growth retardation, morphological abnormality, and even in neurological abnormalities including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors on offspring. However, relatively little is known about the effects of maternal ethanol consumption prior to conception on their offspring. In this study, we investi-gated whether maternal ethanol administration during preconceptional phase produces ADHD-like behaviors in the rat offspring.</p>

This study investigates the effects of paternal exposure to EtOH before conception on the hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity behavior of male offspring in mice. Sire mice were treated with EtOH in a concentration range approximating human binge drinking (0–4 g/kg/day EtOH) for 7 weeks and mated with untreated females mice to produce offspring.</p>

            <p>In previous studies we have demonstrated that the γ-aminobutryic acid-A (GABA-A) receptor antagonist oroxylin A has an awakening effect and it also represses ADHD-like behaviors (hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We hypothesized that the effects of oroxylin A were exerted via the GABA-A receptor given the important role of the GABAergic system in ADHD. However, it is possible that aside from the GABAergic system, oroxylin A may influence other systems especially those implicated in ADHD (e.g. DAergic, etc.). </p>

            <p>A series of 4-benzylpiperidine carboxamides were designed and synthesized, and tested for their dual (serotonin and norepinephrine) reuptake inhibition. The synthesis of 4-benzylpiperidine carboxamides involved two main steps: amidation and substitution. Derivatives with 3 carbon linker displayed better activity than with 2 carbon linker. 4-Biphenyl- and 2-naphthyl-substituted derivatives 7e and 7j showed greater dual reuptake inhibition than standard drug venlafaxine HCl.</p>

We also aimed to identify transcriptional changes that may subserve abuse of these drugs.</p>

            <p>Methoxetamine (MXE) is an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that is chemically and pharmacologically similar to ketamine. Recently, there have been many reports regarding its use/misuse in humans which have resulted in serious or even fatal outcomes. Despite these reports, MXE is not controlled or regulated in many countries which may be partly due to the lack of scientific evidence regarding its abuse potential. </p>

            <p>Several questions remain unanswered concerning the effects of long-term methylphenidate treatment in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has been speculated that repeated methylphenidate treatment may facilitate abuse of the drug or psychological dependence. In the present study, we conducted conditioned place preference (CPP) tests to investigate whether the repeated treatment of methylphenidate results to greater “liking” of the drug.</p>

            <p>Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant given for extended periods of time as a treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The long-term effects of the drug are not yet known, and it is speculated that repeated exposure may produce drug dependence.

            <p>Repeated administration of addictive drugs causes cellular and molecular changes believed to be the mechanism of pro-addictive behaviors. Neuroadaptations also take place with repeated administration of amphetamine, methylphenidate and atomoxetine, drugs for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD), and it is speculated that these changes may serve as markers to demonstrate the dependence liability of these therapies.</p>

            <p>Methylphenidate is the most prescribed stimulant medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Despite the well documented clinical benefits of the drug, several questions remain unanswered concerning the effects of extended methylphenidate use (e.g. can methylphenidate be abused by ADHD patients? does repeated methylphenidate treatment produce addiction?). Preclinical studies can help address the long-term safety of clinical treatments, moreover animal studies provide valuable information on the details of drug actions.</p>

            </a>
            <p style="font-size: 12px;">Kim et al., Journal of Biomedical Science 2010 </p>
            <p>Prenatal ethanol exposure during pregnancy induces a spectrum of mental and physical disorders called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The central nervous system is the main organ influenced by FASD, and neurological symptoms include mental retardation, learning abnormalities, hyperactivity and seizure susceptibility in childhood along with the microcephaly. In this study, we examined whether ethanol exposure adversely affects the proliferation of NPC and de-regulates the normal ratio between glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal differentiation using primary neural progenitor culture (NPC) and in vivo FASD models.</p>

            <p>Prenatal exposure to alcohol has consistently been associated with adverse effects on neurodevelopment, which is collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Increasing evidence suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol increases the risk of developing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like behavior in human. In this study, we investigated the behavioral effects of prenatal exposure to EtOH in offspring mice and rats focusing on hyperactivity and impulsivity.</p>

This study investigates the effects of paternal exposure to EtOH before conception on the hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity behavior of male offspring in mice. Sire mice were treated with EtOH in a concentration range approximating human binge drinking (0–4 g/kg/day EtOH) for 7 weeks and mated with untreated females mice to produce offspring.</p>
