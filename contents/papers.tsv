Design, Synthesis, and Functional Evaluation of 1, 5-Disubstituted Tetrazoles as Monoamine Neurotransmitter Reuptake Inhibitors	2022	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2022 Mar 1;30(2):191-202. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2021.119.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34789584/	Tetrazoles were designed and synthesized as potential inhibitors of triple monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) reuptake based on the functional and docking simulation of compound 6 which were performed in a previous study. The compound structure consisted of a tetrazole-linker (n)-piperidine/piperazine-spacer (m)-phenyl ring, with tetrazole attached to two phenyl rings (R1 and R2). Altering the carbon number in the linker (n) from 3 to 4 and in the spacer (m) from 0 to 1 increased the potency of serotonin reuptake inhibition. Depending on the nature of piperidine/piperazine, the substituents at R1 and R2 exerted various effects in determining their inhibitory effects on monoamine reuptake. Docking study showed that the selectivity of tetrazole for different transporters was determined based on multiple interactions with various residues on transporters, including hydrophobic residues on transmembrane domains 1, 3, 6, and 8. Co-expression of dopamine transporter, which lowers dopamine concentration in the biophase by uptaking dopamine into the cells, inhibited the dopamine-induced endoctytosis of dopamine D2 receptor. When tested for compound 40 and 56, compound 40 which has more potent inhibitory activity on dopamine reuptake more strongly disinhibited the inhibitory activity of dopamine transporter on the endocytosis of dopamine D2 receptor. Overall, we identified candidate inhibitors of triple monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake and provided a theoretical background for identifying such neurotransmitter modifiers for developing novel therapeutic agents of various neuropsychiatric disorders.
Deciphering the role of T-type calcium channels in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis	2021	Acta Physiol (Oxf). 2021 May;232(1):e13643.  doi: 10.1111/apha.13643.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33660407/	
Synergistic efficacy and diminished adverse effect profile of composite treatment of several ADHD medications	2021	Neuropharmacology. 2021 Apr 1;187:108494. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108494.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33587920/	Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is widely studied, problems regarding the adverse effect risks and non-responder problems still need to be addressed. Combination pharmacotherapy using standard dose regimens of existing medication is currently being practiced mainly to augment the therapeutic efficacy of each drug. The idea of combining different pharmacotherapies with different molecular targets to alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and its comorbidities requires scientific evidence, necessitating the investigation of their therapeutic efficacy and the mechanisms underlying the professed synergistic effects. Here, we injected male ICR mice with MK-801 to induce ADHD behavioral condition. We then modeled a "combined drug" using sub-optimal doses of methylphenidate, atomoxetine, and fluoxetine and investigated the combined treatment effects in MK-801-treated mice. No sub-optimal dose monotherapy alleviated ADHD behavioral condition in MK-801-treated mice. However, treatment with the combined drug attenuated the impaired behavior of MK-801-treated animals. Growth impediment, sleep disturbances, or risk of substance abuse were not observed in mice treated subchronically with the combined drugs. Finally, we observed that the combined ADHD drug rescued alterations in p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively, of MK-801-treated mice. Our results provide experimental evidence of a possible new pharmacotherapy option in ameliorating the ADHD behavioral condition without the expected adverse effects. The detailed mechanism of action underlying the synergistic therapeutic efficacy and reduced adverse reaction by combinatorial drug treatment should be investigated further in future studies.
Autism-Like Behavioral Phenotypes in Mice Treated with Systemic N-Methyl-D-Aspartate	2021	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2021 Oct 27. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2021.133.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34702791/	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) having core characteristics of social interaction problems and repetitive behaviors and interests affects individuals at varying degrees and comorbidities, making it difficult to determine the precise etiology underlying the symptoms. Given its heterogeneity, ASD is difficult to treat and the development of therapeutics is slow due to the scarcity of animal models that are easy to produce and screen with. Based on the theory of excitation/inhibition imbalance in the brain with ASD which involves glutamatergic and/or GABAergic neurotransmission, a pharmacologic agent to modulate these receptors might be a good starting point for modeling. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) is an amino acid derivative acting as a specific agonist at the NMDA receptor and therefore imitates the action of the neurotransmitter glutamate on that receptor. In contrast to glutamate, NMDA selectively binds to and regulates the NMDA receptor, but not other glutamate receptors such as AMPA and kainite receptors. Given this role, we aimed to determine whether NMDA administration could result in autistic-like behavior in adolescent mice. Both male and female mice were treated with saline or NMDA (50 and 75 mg/kg) and were tested on various behavior experiments. Interestingly, acute NMDA-treated mice showed social deficits and repetitive behavior similar to ASD phenotypes. These results support the excitation/inhibition imbalance theory of ASD and that NMDA injection can be used as a pharmacologic model of ASD-like behaviors.
R (-)-methoxetamine exerts rapid and sustained antidepressant effects and fewer behavioral side effects relative to S (+)-methoxetamine	2021	Neuropharmacology. 2021 Aug 1;193:108619. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108619.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34023336/	The newfound antidepressant efficacy of ketamine has provided opportunities for the development of new-generation, rapid-acting, glutamate-based antidepressants. We previously identified that methoxetamine (MXE), a ketamine analog, and an N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in mice. MXE (R, S (±)-MXE) is a racemic mixture containing equal parts of S (+)-MXE and R (-)-MXE. However, studies have yet to investigate the antidepressant effects of its enantiomers. Here, we examined the potential antidepressant properties and behavioral side effects of S- and R-MXE in mice. Both S- and R-MXE showed significant NMDA receptor affinity and appreciable inhibitory activity on serotonin transporter. Also, S- and R-MXE (10 mg kg-1) exerted antidepressant effects and increased gamma waves (electroencephalography) but were inhibited by NBQX (an AMPA receptor antagonist). Subsequently, they increased mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation and AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 protein levels in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, they increased 5HT2a and 5HT2c receptor mRNA levels in the prefrontal cortex, with their antidepressant effects inhibited by ketanserin (a 5HT2a/c receptor antagonist). Taken together, S-MXE and R-MXE elicit antidepressant effects that are probably mediated via glutamatergic and serotonergic mechanisms. Unlike S-MXE, R-MXE did not induce prepulse inhibition deficits, hyperlocomotion, conditioned place preference, and locomotor sensitization, although it acutely altered motor coordination. This suggests that R-MXE induces fewer behavioral side effects and is a safer antidepressant than S-MXE. Overall, this study provides significant implications for future research on the next generation of rapid-acting, glutamate-based antidepressant drugs.
Catalpol and Mannitol, Two Components of Rehmannia glutinosa, Exhibit Anticonvulsant Effects Probably via GABA A Receptor Regulation	2020	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2020 Mar 1;28(2):137-144. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2019.130.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31739380/	Epilepsy is a brain disorder that affects millions of people worldwide and is usually managed using currently available antiepileptic drugs, which result in adverse effects and are ineffective in approximately 20-25% of patients. Thus, there is growing interest in the development of new antiepileptic drugs with fewer side effects. In a previous study, we showed that a Rehmannia glutinosa (RG) water extract has protective effects against electroshock- and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures, with fewer side effects. In this study, the objective was to identify the RG components that are responsible for its anticonvulsant effects. Initially, a number of RG components (aucubin, acteoside, catalpol, and mannitol) were screened, and the anticonvulsant effects of different doses of catalpol, mannitol, and their combination on electroshock- and chemically (PTZ or strychnine)-induced seizures in mice, were further assessed. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor binding assay and electroencephalography (EEG) analysis were conducted to identify the potential underlying drug mechanism. Additionally, treated mice were tested using open-field and rotarod tests. Catalpol, mannitol, and their combination increased threshold against electroshock-induced seizures, and decreased the percentage of seizure responses induced by PTZ, a GABA antagonist. GABA receptor binding assay results revealed that catalpol and mannitol are associated with GABA receptor activity, and EEG analysis provided evidence that catalpol and mannitol have anticonvulsant effects against PTZ-induced seizures. In summary, our results indicate that catalpol and mannitol have anticonvulsant properties, and may mediate the protective effects of RG against seizures.
A novel molecular mechanism responsible for phosphorylation-independent desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors exemplified by the dopamine D 3 receptor	2020	Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2020 Jul 30;528(3):432-439. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.197. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32505358/	GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation followed by association with β-arrestins has been proposed to be the molecular mechanism involved in the desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, this mechanism does not explain the desensitization of some GPCRs, such as dopamine D3 receptor (D3R), which does not undergo GRK-mediated phosphorylation. Loss-of-function approaches and mutants of dopamine D2 receptor and D3R, which exhibit different desensitization properties, were used to identify the cellular components and processes responsible for desensitization. D3R mediated the recruitment of Mdm2 to the cytosol, which resulted in the constitutive ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 in the resting state. Under desensitization conditions, cytosolic Mdm2 returned to the nucleus, resulting in the deubiquitination of cytosolic β-arrestins. Deubiquitinated β-arrestins formed a tight complex with Gβγ, thereby sequestering it, causing interference in D3R signaling. In conclusion, this study shows that β-arrestins, depending on their ubiquitination status, control the G protein cycling by regulating their interactions with Gβγ. This is a novel mechanism proposed to explain how certain GPCRs can undergo desensitization without receptor phosphorylation.
Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 in the nucleus occurs in a Gβγ- and clathrin-dependent manner	2020	Biochem Pharmacol. 2020 Aug;178:114049. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2020.114049.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32450252/	The fate and activity of β-arrestin2, a key player in the regulation of desensitization and endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are regulated by mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2)-mediated ubiquitination. However, details of the molecular mechanisms of β-arrestin2 ubiquitination remain unclear. Studies on β-arrestin2 and Mdm2 mutants with modified nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties have revealed that β-arrestin2 ubiquitination occurs in the nucleus in a Gβγ- and clathrin-dependent manner. The nuclear entry of both β-arrestin2 and Mdm2 commonly relies on the presence of importin complex but can occur independently of each other. Gβγ and clathrin regulated the nuclear entry of β-arrestin2 by mediating the interaction between β-arrestin2 and importin β1. In contrast, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of two serine residues of Mdm2 partly regulated the nuclear entry of Mdm2. Ubiquitinated β-arrestin2 along with Mdm2 translocated to the cytoplasm where they play various functional roles including receptor endocytosis and ubiquitination of other cytoplasmic proteins. The nuclear export of Mdm2 required nuclear entry and interaction of β-arrestin2 with Mdm2. Ubiquitination was required for the translocation of β-arrestin2 toward activated receptors on the plasma membrane and for its endocytic activity. The current study revealed the cellular components and processes involved in the ubiquitination of β-arrestin2, and these findings could be quintessential for providing directions and detailed strategies for the manipulation of GPCR functions and development of GPCR-related therapeutics.
Sex-specific Behavioral Features of Rodent Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder	2018	Exp Neurobiol. 2018 Oct;27(5):321-343. doi: 10.5607/en.2018.27.5.321.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30429643/	Sex is an important factor in understanding the clinical presentation, management, and developmental trajectory of children with neuropsychiatric disorders. While much is known about the clinical and neurobehavioral profiles of males with neuropsychiatric disorders, surprisingly little is known about females in this respect. Animal models may provide detailed mechanistic information about sex differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in terms of manifestation, disease progression, and development of therapeutic options. This review aims to widen our understanding of the role of sex in autism spectrum disorder, by summarizing and comparing behavioral characteristics of animal models. Our current understanding of how differences emerge in boys and girls with neuropsychiatric disorders is limited: Information derived from animal studies will stimulate future research on the role of biological maturation rates, sex hormones, sex-selective protective (or aggravating) factors and psychosocial factors, which are essential to devise sex precision medicine and to improve diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, there is a strong need of novel strategies to elucidate the major mechanisms leading to sex-specific autism features, as well as novel models or methods to examine these sex differences.
Modelling monogenic autism spectrum disorder using mouse cortical organoids	2020	Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2020 Jan 1;521(1):164-171. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.097.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31653345/	Variants of the contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), which is a member of the neurexin family of proteins, function as cell adhesion molecules. The loss of CNTNAP2 function leads to autism spectrum disorder in humans and to autistic behaviours in mice. However, the functional effects of these mutations at the cellular level during fetal developmental periods remain elusive. Here, we studied mouse cortical organoids (mCOs) derived from Cntnap2-/- (knockout, KO) mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs). Our results showed that KO mCOs displayed inhibitory-neuron-specific defects. At the neural progenitor stage, the GABAergic-neurogenesis-governing transcriptional network was dysregulated in the absence of Cntnap2. Our findings suggest that, in the early fetal cortical development, the cell adhesion molecule Cntnap2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of the differentiation of GABAergic neurons in the organoid platform. The reduced number of GABAergic neurons was efficiently restored in KO mCOs by treatment with the antiepileptic drug retigabine, showing the effectiveness of Cntnap2 KO mCOs in the therapeutic targeting of ASD.
Recapitulation of Neuropsychiatric Behavioral Features in Mice Using Acute Low-dose MK-801 Administration	2019	Exp Neurobiol. 2019 Dec 31;28(6):697-708. doi: 10.5607/en.2019.28.6.697.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31902157/	Despite some innate limitations, animal models are a potent investigative tool when used to model specific symptoms of a disorder. For example, MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, is used as a pharmacological tool to induce symptoms found in some neuropsychiatric disorders. However, a close examination of literature suggests that the application window of MK-801 doses is relatively narrow between individual behavioral paradigms, necessitating careful characterization of the evoked behavioral aberrations and the doses used to induce them. Moreover, variation in behaviors depending on the animal strain, gender of the subject, and the timing of administration is observed, making it difficult to compare the behavioral characteristics reported in different studies. We aim to characterize the behavioral aberrations induced by different doses of MK-801 in CD-1 mice and create a ready reference for future studies. We used CD-1 mice to recapitulate behavioral impairments resulting from acute administration of MK-801. In 0.1 mg kg-1, we observed diminished spontaneous alteration during the Y-maze test, while 0.12 mg kg-1 resulted in hyperlocomotion and social deficit. Mice treated with 0.2 and 0.3 mg kg-1 of MK-801 demonstrated a decreased self-grooming. Finally, all doses significantly impaired cliff avoidance behaviors suggesting increased impulsivity. These results affirm that MK-801 can effectively model various symptoms of different neuropsychiatric disorders in a dose-dependent manner. The observed sensitivity against spatial-memory impairment and impulsive behaviors at low concentration of MK-801 suggest that MK801 may modulate cognitive function and impulsivity in even lower concentration before it can modulate other behavioral domains.
Comparative Behavioral Correlation of High and Low-Performing Mice in the Forced Swim Test	2019	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2019 Jul 1;27(4):349-356. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2018.210.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30630289/	Behavioral analysis in mice provided important contributions in helping understand and treat numerous neurobehavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. The behavioral performance of animals and humans is widely different among individuals but the neurobehavioral mechanism of the innate difference is seldom investigated. Many neurologic conditions share comorbid symptoms that may have common pathophysiology and therapeutic strategy. The forced swim test (FST) has been commonly used to evaluate the "antidepressant" properties of drugs yet the individual difference analysis of this test was left scantly investigated along with the possible connection among other behavioral domains. This study conducted an FST-screening in outbred CD-1 male mice and segregated them into three groups: high performers (HP) or the active swimmers, middle performers (MP), and low performers (LP) or floaters. After which, a series of behavioral experiments were performed to measure their behavioral responses in the open field, elevated plus maze, Y maze, three-chamber social assay, novel object recognition, delay discounting task, and cliff avoidance reaction. The behavioral tests battery revealed that the three groups displayed seemingly correlated differences in locomotor activity and novel object recognition but not in other behaviors. This study suggests that the HP group in FST has higher locomotor activity and novelty-seeking tendencies compared to the other groups. These results may have important implications in creating behavior database in animal models that could be used for predicting interconnections of various behavioral domains, which eventually helps to understand the neurobiological mechanism controlling the behaviors in individual subjects.
Effects of Intraperitoneal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Administration on Nociceptive/Repetitive Behaviors in Juvenile Mice	2019	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2019 Mar 1;27(2):168-177. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2018.230.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30580503/	Dysregulation of excitatory neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Pharmacological inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is widely used to model neurobehavioral pathologies and underlying mechanisms. There is ample evidence that overstimulation of NMDA-dependent neurotransmission may induce neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as repetitive behaviors and hypersensitization to nociception and cognitive disruption, pharmacological modeling using NMDA has been limited due to the induction of neurotoxicity and blood brain barrier breakdown, especially in young animals. In this study, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal NMDA-administration on nociceptive and repetitive behaviors in ICR mice. Intraperitoneal injection of NMDA induced repetitive grooming and tail biting/licking behaviors in a dose- and age-dependent manner. Nociceptive and repetitive behaviors were more prominent in juvenile mice than adult mice. We did not observe extensive blood brain barrier breakdown or neuronal cell death after peritoneal injection of NMDA, indicating limited neurotoxic effects despite a significant increase in NMDA concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. These findings suggest that the observed behavioral changes were not mediated by general NMDA toxicity. In the hot plate test, we found that the latency of paw licking and jumping decreased in the NMDA-exposed mice especially in the 75 mg/kg group, suggesting increased nociceptive sensitivity in NMDA-treated animals. Repetitive behaviors and increased pain sensitivity are often comorbid in psychiatric disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder). Therefore, the behavioral characteristics of intraperitoneal NMDA-administered mice described herein may be valuable for studying the mechanisms underlying relevant disorders and screening candidate therapeutic molecules.
Pharmacological modulation of AMPA receptor rescues social impairments in animal models of autism	2019	Neuropsychopharmacology. 2019 Jan;44(2):314-323. doi: 10.1038/s41386-018-0098-5.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29899405/	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, featuring social communication deficit and repetitive/restricted behaviors as common symptoms. Its prevalence has continuously increased, but, till now, there are no therapeutic approaches to relieve the core symptoms, particularly social deficit. In previous studies, abnormal function of the glutamatergic neural system has been proposed as a critical mediator and therapeutic target of ASD-associated symptoms. Here, we investigated the possible roles of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in autism symptoms using two well-known autistic animal models, Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mice and in utero valproic acid-exposed ICR (VPA) mice. We found that Cntnap2 KO mice displayed decreased glutamate receptor expression and transmission. Contrarily, VPA mice exhibited increased glutamate receptor expression and transmission. Next, we investigated whether AMPAR modulators (positive-allosteric-modulator for Cntnap2 KO mice and antagonist for VPA mice) can improve autistic symptoms by normalizing the aberrant excitatory transmission in the respective animal models. Interestingly, the AMPAR modulation specifically ameliorated social deficits in both animal models. These results indicated that AMPAR-derived excitatory neural transmission changes can affect normal social behavior. To validate this, we injected an AMPAR agonist or antagonist in control ICR mice and, interestingly, these treatments impaired only the social behavior, without affecting the repetitive and hyperactive behaviors. Collectively, these results provide insight into the role of AMPARs in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of ASD, and demonstrate that modulation of AMPAR can be a potential target for the treatment of social behavior deficits associated with ASD.
Social Interaction Test in Home Cage as a Novel and Ethological Measure of Social Behavior in Mice	2019	Exp Neurobiol. 2019 Apr;28(2):247-260. doi: 10.5607/en.2019.28.2.247. Epub 2019 Apr 30.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31138992/	Sociability is the disposition to interact with one another. Rodents have a rich repertoire of social behaviors and demonstrate strong sociability. Various methods have been established to measure the sociability of rodents in simple and direct ways, which includes reciprocal social interaction, juvenile social play, and three-chamber social tests. There are possible confounding factors while performing some of these tasks, such as aggression, avoidance of interaction by the stimulus mouse, exposure to a new environment, and lengthy procedures. The present study devised a method to complement these shortcomings and measure sociability as a group in the home cage setting, which prevents group-housed mice from isolation or exposure to a new environment. The home cage social test can allow high-throughput screening of social behaviors in a short amount of time. We developed two types of home cage setup: a home cage social target interaction test that measures sociability by putting the wire cage in the center area of the cage and a home cage two-choice sociability and social preference test that measures both sociability or social preference by putting cage racks at opposite sides of the cage. Interestingly, our results showed that the two types of home cage setup that we used in this study can extract abnormal social behaviors in various animal models, similar to the three-chamber assay. Thus, this study establishes a new and effective method to measure sociability or social preference that could be a complementary assay to evaluate the social behavior of mice in various setup conditions.
The circadian gene, Per2, influences methamphetamine sensitization and reward through the dopaminergic system in the striatum of mice	2019	Addict Biol. 2019 Sep;24(5):946-957. doi: 10.1111/adb.12663. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30091820/	Drug addiction is a chronic and relapsing brain disorder, influenced by complex interactions between endogenous and exogenous factors. Per2, a circadian gene, plays a role in drug addiction. Previous studies using Per2-knockout mice have shown a role for Per2 in cocaine, morphine and alcohol addiction. In the present study, we investigated the role of Per2 in methamphetamine (METH) addiction using Per2-overexpression and knockout mice. We observed locomotor sensitization responses to METH administration, and rewarding effects using a conditioned place preference test. In addition, we measured expression levels of dopamine and dopamine-related genes (monoamine oxidase A, DA receptor 1, DA receptor 2, DA active transporter, tyrosine hydroxylase and cAMP response element-binding protein 1) in the striatum of the mice after repeated METH treatments, using qRT-PCR. Per2-overexpressed mice showed decreased locomotor sensitization and rewarding effects of METH compared to the wildtype mice, whereas the opposite was observed in Per2 knockout mice. Both types of transgenic mice showed altered expression levels of dopamine-related genes after repeated METH administration. Specifically, we observed lower dopamine levels in Per2-overexpressed mice and higher levels in Per2-knockout mice. Taken together, Per2 expression levels may influence the addictive effects of METH through the dopaminergic system in the striatum of mice.
Methoxetamine: A foe or friend?	2019	Neurochem Int. 2019 Jan;122:1-7. doi: 10.1016/j.neuint.2018.10.020. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30365979/	Methoxetamine (MXE) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that is chemically and pharmacologically similar to other dissociative substances, such as ketamine and phencyclidine. There are reports on the misuse of MXE, which sometimes resulted in adverse consequences and death. Studies have also shown that MXE has abuse liability and stimulates dopamine neurotransmission in the mesolimbic reward pathway in the brain. These findings have contributed to the negative impression on MXE. However, recent preclinical studies have identified the antidepressant properties of MXE, which are attributed to its ability to affect the glutamatergic and serotonergic systems. MXE is also reported to have analgesic effects. These findings show some of the "redeeming qualities" of MXE and indicate its possible therapeutic uses. In this paper, we have reviewed the findings that provide insights into the adverse and potential therapeutic effects of MXE. We compiled studies on the toxicity, psychotomimetic effects, and abuse liability of MXE, as well as its promising antidepressant and analgesic properties. We also have discussed the mechanism of action that might mediate the somewhat paradoxical effects observed. Importantly, this review provides valuable information on MXE for future research and will enable a better understanding of its psychopharmacological properties and the mechanisms responsible for its unique effects.
The Atxn7-overexpressing mice showed hyperactivity and impulsivity which were ameliorated by atomoxetine treatment: A possible animal model of the hyperactive-impulsive phenotype of ADHD	2019	Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 2019 Jan 10;88:311-319. doi: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.08.012.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30125623/	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by varying levels of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. Patients with ADHD are often classified as (1) predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, (2) predominantly inattentive, and (3) combined type. There is a growing interest in developing specific animal models that would recapitulate specific clinical forms of ADHD, with the goal of developing specific therapeutic strategies. In our previous study, we have identified Ataxin-7 (Atxn7) as a hyperactivity-associated gene. Here, we generated Atxn7 overexpressing (Atxn7 OE) mice to investigate whether the increased Atxn7 expression in the brain correlates with ADHD-like behaviors. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence confirmed overexpression of the Atxn7 gene and protein in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum (STR) of the Atxn7 OE mice. The Atxn7 OE mice displayed hyperactivity and impulsivity, but not inattention. Interestingly, treatment with the ADHD drug, atomoxetine (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), attenuated ADHD-like behaviors and reduced Atxn7 gene expression in the PFC and STR of these mice. These findings suggest that Atxn7 plays a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD, and that the Atxn7 OE mice can be used as an animal model of the hyperactive-impulsive phenotype of this disorder. Although confirmatory studies are warranted, the present study provides valuable information regarding the potential genetic underpinnings of ADHD.
Gene-environment interaction counterbalances social impairment in mouse models of autism	2019	Sci Rep. 2019 Aug 7;9(1):11490. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-47680-w.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31391512/	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication deficits and repetitive/restricted behaviors. Although gene-environment interactions may explain the heterogeneous etiology of ASD, it is still largely unknown how the gene-environment interaction affects behavioral symptoms and pathophysiology in ASD. To address these questions, we used Cntnap2 knockout mice (genetic factor, G) exposed to valproic acid during embryonic development (environmental factor, E) as a gene-environment interaction (G × E) model. Paradoxically, the social deficits observed in the respective G and E models were improved in the G × E model; however, the high seizure susceptibility was more severe in the G × E -model than in the G and E models. Repetitive self-grooming and hyperactivity did not differ among the three models. The amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex were aberrant and similar in the G × E model when compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that the interaction of two risk factors does not always aggravate ASD symptoms but can also alleviate them, which may be key to understanding individual differences in behavioral phenotypes and symptom intensity.
Effects of Several Cosmetic Preservatives on ROS-Dependent Apoptosis of Rat Neural Progenitor Cells	2018	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2018 Nov 1;26(6):608-615. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2017.221.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29429147/	Benzalkonium chloride, diazolidinyl urea, and imidazolidinyl urea are commonly used preservatives in cosmetics. Recent reports suggested that these compounds may have cellular and systemic toxicity in high concentration. In addition, diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea are known formaldehyde (FA) releasers, raising concerns for these cosmetic preservatives. In this study, we investigated the effects of benzalkonium chloride, diazolidinyl urea, and imidazolidinyl urea on ROS-dependent apoptosis of rat neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro. Cells were isolated and cultured from embryonic day 14 rat cortices. Cultured cells were treated with 1-1,000 nM benzalkonium chloride, and 1-50 μM diazolidinyl urea or imidazolidinyl urea at various time points to measure the reactive oxygen species (ROS). PI staining, MTT assay, and live-cell imaging were used for cell viability measurements. Western blot was carried out for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-8 as apoptotic protein markers. In rat NPCs, ROS production and cleaved caspase-8 expression were increased while the cell viability was decreased in high concentrations of these substances. These results suggest that several cosmetic preservatives at high concentrations can induce neural toxicity in rat brains through ROS induction and apoptosis.
Design, synthesis and docking study of 4-arylpiperazine carboxamides as monoamine neurotransmitters reuptake inhibitors	2018	Bioorg Med Chem. 2018 Aug 7;26(14):4127-4135. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2018.06.043	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30007567/	Rational drug design method has been used to generate 4-arylpiperazine carboxamides in an effort to develop safer, more potent and effective monoamine neurotransmitters reuptake inhibitors. Out of twenty-seven synthesized compounds, compound 9 displayed potent monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitory activity against HEK cells transfected with hSERT or hNET. A Surflex-Dock docking model of 9 was also studied.
Design, synthesis, and systematic evaluation of 4-arylpiperazine- and 4-benzylpiperidine napthyl ethers as inhibitors of monoamine neurotransmitters reuptake	2018	Bioorg Med Chem. 2018 Nov 1;26(20):5538-5546. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2018.09.033.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30293797/	Two series of 4-arylpiperazine- and 4-benzylpiperidine naphthyl ethers were designed based on structure-activity relationship (SAR) and docking model of reported monoamine neurotransmitters reuptake inhibitors. The compounds were synthesized in 3-simple steps and their biological activities were evaluated. Several compounds were proven to be potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Computer docking was performed to study the interaction of the most potent compound 35 with human serotonin transporter. The results of the analyses suggest that 4-arylpiperazine- and 4-benzylpiperidine naphthyl ethers might be promising antidepressants worthy of further studies.
T-Type Calcium Channels Are Required to Maintain Viability of Neural Progenitor Cells	2018	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2018 Sep 1;26(5):439-445. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2017.223.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463073/	T-type calcium channels are low voltage-activated calcium channels that evoke small and transient calcium currents. Recently, T-type calcium channels have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and neural tube defects. However, their function during embryonic development is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the function and expression of T-type calcium channels in embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs). First, we compared the expression of T-type calcium channel subtypes (CaV3.1, 3.2, and 3.3) in NPCs and differentiated neural cells (neurons and astrocytes). We detected all subtypes in neurons but not in astrocytes. In NPCs, CaV3.1 was the dominant subtype, whereas CaV3.2 was weakly expressed, and CaV3.3 was not detected. Next, we determined CaV3.1 expression levels in the cortex during early brain development. Expression levels of CaV3.1 in the embryonic period were transiently decreased during the perinatal period and increased at postnatal day 11. We then pharmacologically blocked T-type calcium channels to determine the effects in neuronal cells. The blockade of T-type calcium channels reduced cell viability, and induced apoptotic cell death in NPCs but not in differentiated astrocytes. Furthermore, blocking T-type calcium channels rapidly reduced AKT-phosphorylation (Ser473) and GSK3β-phosphorylation (Ser9). Our results suggest that T-type calcium channels play essential roles in maintaining NPC viability, and T-type calcium channel blockers are toxic to embryonic neural cells, and may potentially be responsible for neurodevelopmental disorders.
Overexpression of the Thyroid Hormone-Responsive (THRSP) Gene in the Striatum Leads to the Development of Inattentive-like Phenotype in Mice	2018	Neuroscience. 2018 Oct 15;390:141-150. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2018.08.008. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30138648/	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 8-12% of children globally. Factor analyses have divided ADHD symptoms into two domains: inattention and a combination of hyperactivity and impulsivity. The identification of domain-specific genetic risk variants may help uncover potential genetic mechanisms underlying ADHD. We have previously identified that thyroid hormone-responsive (THRSP) gene expression is upregulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR/NCrl) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY/NCrl) rats which exhibited inattention behavior. Thus, we established a line of THRSP overexpressing (OE) mice and assessed their behavior through an array of behavioral tests. The gene and protein overexpression of THRSP in the striatum (STR) was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. The THRSP OE mice exhibited inattention in the novel-object recognition and Y-maze test, but not hyperactivity in the open-field test and impulsivity in the cliff-avoidance and delay-discounting task. We have also found that expression of dopamine-related genes (dopamine transporter, tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopamine D1 and D2 receptors) in the STR increased. Treatment with methylphenidate (5 mg/kg), the most commonly used medication for ADHD, improved attention and normalized expression levels of dopamine-related genes in THRSP OE mice. Our findings suggest that THRSP plays a role in the inattention phenotype of ADHD and that the THRSP OE mice may be used as an animal model to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of the disorder.
Design, synthesis, and evaluation of bitopic arylpiperazine-phthalimides as selective dopamine D 3 receptor agonists	2018	Medchemcomm. 2018 Jun 14;9(9):1457-1465. doi: 10.1039/c8md00237a. eCollection 2018 Sep 1.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30288220/	The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) is a proven therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, D3R-selective ligands that can eliminate side effects associated with dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) therapeutics have been validated. However, the high homology in signaling pathways and the sequence similarity between D2R and D3R have rendered the development of D3R-selective ligands challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of piperazine-phthalimide bitopic ligands based on a fragment-based and molecular docking inspired design. Compound 9i was identified as the most selective D3R ligand among these bitopic ligands. Its selectivity was improved compared to reference compounds 1 and 2 by 9- and 2-fold, respectively, and it was 21-fold more potent than compound 2. Molecular docking demonstrated that the orientation of Leu2.64 and Phe7.39 and the packing at the junction of helices may affect the specificity for D3R over D2R. Functional evaluation revealed that D3R-selective ligand 9i displayed a subpicomolar agonist activity at D3R with a 199-fold increase in potency compared to quinpirole. These results may be useful for the fragment-based design of bitopic compounds as selective D3R ligands.
Recent Development of Small Molecule Glutaminase Inhibitors	2018	Curr Top Med Chem. 2018;18(6):432-443. doi: 10.2174/1568026618666180525100830.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29793408/	Glutaminase (GLS), which is responsible for the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, plays a vital role in up-regulating cell metabolism for tumor cell growth and is considered to be a valuable therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Based on this important function of glutaminase in cancer, several GLS inhibitors have been developed in both academia and industry. Most importantly, Calithera Biosciences Inc. is actively developing the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 for the treatment of various cancers, and it is currently being evaluated in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. In this review, recent efforts to develop small molecule glutaminase inhibitors that target glutamine metabolism in both preclinical and clinical studies are discussed. In particular, more emphasis is placed on CB-839 because it is the only small molecule GLS inhibitor being studied in a clinical setting. The inhibition mechanism is also discussed based on X-ray structure studies of thiadiazole derivatives present in glutaminase inhibitor BPTES. Finally, recent medicinal chemistry efforts to develop a new class of GLS inhibitors are described in the hopes of providing useful information for the next generation of GLS inhibitors.
Social support rescues acute stress-induced cognitive impairments by modulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation in adolescent mice	2018	Sci Rep. 2018 Aug 13;8(1):12003. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-30524-4.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30104581/	Social support can relieve stress-induced behavioural outcomes, although its underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we evaluated whether social interactions can prevent the restraint stress (RS)-induced cognitive impairments in male adolescent mice by utilizing molecular, cellular, and behavioural approaches. Acute RS in adolescent ICR mice impaired the working memory in the Y-maze test and memory consolidation and retrieval in the novel-object-recognition test (NORT). In addition, RS increased the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and corticosterone levels in the plasma. Interestingly, these outcomes were normalized by the presence of a conspecific animal (social support) during RS. RS also significantly upregulated the expression levels of known stress-relevant genes such as Egr1, Crh, and Crhr1, which were normalized by social support. Systemic injection of SL327 (an inhibitor of MEK1/2 that also blocks its downstream signal ERK1/2) prior to RS rescued the working memory impairments and the increased p-ERK1/2 while normalizing the expression of Egr1. Our results suggest that social support can alleviate the RS-induced cognitive impairments partly by modulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation and gene transcription in the PFC, and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the stress-buffering effects of social support.
Transcriptional profiling of SHR/NCrl prefrontal cortex shows hyperactivity-associated genes responsive to amphetamine challenge	2017	Genes Brain Behav. 2017 Sep;16(7):664-674. doi: 10.1111/gbb.12388. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28422445/	Several studies suggest a strong genetic component of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Determining specific genetic risk variants for each symptom dimension of ADHD may aid in the identification of the biological risk factors of the disorder. In this study, we explored the potential genetic underpinnings of the hyperactive phenotype of ADHD. To this end, we examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of SHR/NCrl, an animal model of ADHD, compared with its genetic control, the Wistar Kyoto (WKY/NCrl) rat and the Wistar rat, strain used to represent the 'normal' heterogeneous population. Relative to WKY/NCrl and Wistar controls, SHR/NCrl showed hyperactivity in the open-field test. Treatment with the ADHD drug, amphetamine (AMPH) reduced hyperactivity in SHR/NCrl. Meanwhile, AMPH increased locomotor activity in WKY/NCrl and Wistar rats. Gene expression analysis found 21 common upregulated and 36 downregulated genes in the PFC of drug-naive SHR/NCrl when compared with WKY/NCrl and Wistar rats. Of these DEGs, expression levels of two genes, Atxn7 and Per2, which are involved in transcription and circadian rhythm, respectively, were downregulated following AMPH treatment in SHR/NCrl. Quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction analyses verified expression patterns of these genes in the PFC of drug-naïve and AMPH-treated SHR/NCrl. The present findings indicate genetic risk variants that may be associated with the hyperactive phenotype in ADHD. Further studies are warranted to establish the roles of Atxn7 and Per2 in mediating hyperactivity.
Methylphenidate and Atomoxetine-Responsive Prefrontal Cortical Genetic Overlaps in "Impulsive" SHR/NCrl and Wistar Rats	2017	Behav Genet. 2017 Sep;47(5):564-580. doi: 10.1007/s10519-017-9861-3.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28744604/	Impulsivity, the predisposition to act prematurely without foresight, is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Identifying genetic underpinnings of impulsive behavior may help decipher the complex etiology and neurobiological factors of disorders marked by impulsivity. To identify potential genetic factors of impulsivity, we examined common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adolescent SHR/NCrl and Wistar rats, which showed marked decrease in preference for the large but delayed reward, compared with WKY/NCrl rats, in the delay discounting task. Of these DEGs, we examined drug-responsive transcripts whose mRNA levels were altered following treatment (in SHR/NCrl and Wistar rats) with drugs that alleviate impulsivity, namely, the ADHD medications methylphenidate and atomoxetine. Prefrontal cortical genetic overlaps between SHR/NCrl and Wistar rats in comparison with WKY/NCrl included genes associated with transcription (e.g., Btg2, Fos, Nr4a2), synaptic plasticity (e.g., Arc, Homer2), and neuron apoptosis (Grik2, Nmnat1). Treatment with methylphenidate and/or atomoxetine increased choice of the large, delayed reward in SHR/NCrl and Wistar rats and changed, in varying degrees, mRNA levels of Nr4a2, Btg2, and Homer2, genes with previously described roles in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by impulsivity. While further studies are required, we dissected potential genetic factors that may influence impulsivity by identifying genetic overlaps in the PFC of "impulsive" SHR/NCrl and Wistar rats. Notably, these are also drug-responsive transcripts which may be studied further as biomarkers to predict response to ADHD drugs, and as potential targets for the development of treatments to improve impulsivity.
Common prefrontal cortical gene expression profiles between adolescent SHR/NCrl and WKY/NCrl rats which showed inattention behavior	2015	Behav Brain Res. 2015 Sep 15;291:268-276. doi: 10.1016/j.bbr.2015.05.012.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26048425/	Factor analyses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) symptoms divide the behavioral symptoms of ADHD into two separate domains, one reflecting inattention and the other, a combination of hyperactivity and impulsivity. Identifying domain-specific genetic risk variants may aid in the discovery of specific biological risk factors for ADHD. In contrast with data available on genes involved in hyperactivity and impulsivity, there is limited information on the genetic influences of inattention. Transcriptional profiling analysis in animal models of disorders may provide an important tool to identify genetic involvement in behavioral phenotypes. To explore some of the potential genetic underpinnings of ADHD inattention, we examined common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the prefrontal cortex of SHR/NCrl, the most validated animal model of ADHD and WKY/NCrl, animal model of ADHD-inattentive type. In contrast with Wistar rats, strain representing the "normal" heterogeneous population, SHR/NCrl and WKY/NCrl showed inattention behavior in the Y-maze task. The common DEGs in the PFC of SHR/NCrl and WKY/NCrl vs. Wistar rats are those involved in transcription (e.g. Creg1, Thrsp, Zeb2), synaptic transmission (e.g. Atp2b2, Syt12, Chrna5), neurological system process (e.g. Atg7, Cacnb4, Grin3a), and immune response (e.g. Atg7, Ip6k2, Mx2). qRT-PCR analyses validated expression patterns of genes representing the major functional gene families among the DEGs (Grin3a, Thrsp, Vof-16 and Zeb2). Although further studies are warranted, the present findings indicate novel genes associated with known functional pathways of relevance to ADHD which are assumed to play important roles in the etiology of ADHD-inattentive subtype.
High sucrose consumption during pregnancy induced ADHD-like behavioral phenotypes in mice offspring	2015	J Nutr Biochem. 2015 Dec;26(12):1520-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.07.018. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26452319/	In recent years, the average consumption of sugar in humans from all ages has remarkably increased, exceeding the recommended limit. Pregnancy is a critical time for the global development of offsprings who are vulnerable to the deleterious effects of environmental factors. In this study, we investigated whether high sucrose consumption during pregnancy could affect the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring mice. Pregnant mice were randomly grouped and orally administered with either water as control (Con) or 30% wt/vol sucrose diluted in water at 6 (Suc6) or 9 (Suc9) g/kg dosage per day from gestational days 6 to 15. After the weaning period, offspring mice underwent a series of behavioral testing for locomotor activity, attention, and impulsivity. Although there is no obvious difference in gross development of offspring mice such as weight gain, high sucrose-exposed offspring mice showed a significantly increased locomotor activity. Moreover, these mice exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in attention and increase in impulsivity. In the striatum, a significantly increased dopamine transporter (DAT) mRNA expression was found in the Suc9 group along with dose-dependent decreases in the Drd1, Drd2 and Drd4 dopamine receptor subtypes. Furthermore, synaptosomal DAT protein expression was increased about twofold in the Suc9 group. Prenatal fructose exposure also induced hyperactive behavior in offspring mice suggesting the essential role of fructose in the dysregulated neurobehavioral development. These findings suggest prenatal sucrose consumption as a new risk factor for ADHD, which may need further attention and investigation in humans.
Individual differences in novelty-seeking behavior in spontaneously hypertensive rats: Enhanced sensitivity to the reinforcing effect of methylphenidate in the high novelty-preferring subpopulation	2015	J Neurosci Methods. 2015 Aug 30;252:48-54. doi: 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2014.08.019.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25169048/	"Background: High novelty seeking has been assumed to predict vulnerability to use addictive drugs. Notably, it is also a symptom associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim of this study was to identify whether spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), putative animal models of ADHD, display individual differences in novelty-seeking behavior, and whether high novelty-seeking SHRs show enhanced sensitivity to the reinforcing effect of methylphenidate, the most commonly prescribed stimulant ADHD medication. Methods: First, we established that SHRs show higher levels of novelty-seeking behavior than their normotensive control strain, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Novelty seeking was measured in two tests: open field test in a novel test arena, and novel object preference tests. Thereafter, SHRs were classified into high responders (HR) or low responders (LR), high novelty-preferring (HNP) or low novelty-preferring (LNP) rats, based on individual scores in the two behavioral assays. Methylphenidate self-administration was assessed thereafter. Results: SHRs showed higher levels of novelty-seeking behavior than WKY rats. HR/LR and HNP/LNP subgroups were identified. HR and LR rats showed comparable rates of methylphenidate self-administration. However, HNP SHRs worked more for methylphenidate infusions than their LNP counterparts. Conclusions: We showed some evidence on inter-individual variations in novelty seeking in SHRs. Importantly, we demonstrated enhanced sensitivity of HNP SHRs to the reinforcing effect of methylphenidate, indicating a ""drug-vulnerable"" SHR subpopulation. These findings are important as they may provide basis for a potential screening tool to identify a subset of ADHD patients (i.e. high novelty seekers) who may be at risk for misusing/abusing methylphenidate."
Effects of atomoxetine on hyper-locomotive activity of the prenatally valproate-exposed rat offspring	2014	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2014 Sep;22(5):406-13. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2014.027.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25414770/	A substantial proportion of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) display hyperactivity as a comorbid symptom. Exposure to valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy produces ASD-like core behavioral phenotypes as well as hyperactivity in offspring both in human and experimental animals, which makes it a plausible model to study ASD-related neurobiological processes. In this study, we examined the effects of two of currently available attention defecit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications, methylphenidate (MPH) and atomoxetine (ATX) targeting dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET), respectively, on hyperactive behavior of prenatally VPA-exposed rat offspring. In the prefrontal cortex of VPA exposed rat offspring, both mRNA and protein expression of DAT was increased as compared with control. VPA function as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the acetylation of histone bound to DAT gene promoter was increased in VPA-exposed rat offspring suggesting epigenetic mechanism of DAT regulation. Similarly, the expression of NET was increased, possibly via increased histone acetylation in prefrontal cortex of VPA-exposed rat offspring. When we treated the VPA-exposed rat offspring with ATX, a NET selective inhibitor, hyperactivity was reversed to control level. In contrast, MPH that inhibits both DAT and NET, did not produce inhibitory effects against hyperactivity. The results suggest that NET abnormalities may underlie the hyperactive phenotype in VPA animal model of ASD. Profiling the pharmacological responsiveness as well as investigating underlying mechanism in multiple models of ASD and ADHD may provide more insights into the neurobiological correlates regulating the behavioral abnormalities.
The effects of atomoxetine and methylphenidate on the prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response in mice	2014	Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 2014 Oct 3;54:206-15. doi: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2014.06.003	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24953433/	Atomoxetine (ATM) and methylphenidate (MPD) have been used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ATM is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, whereas MPD is a psychostimulant and acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ATM (1, 3 or 10mg/kg) and MPD (5, 10 or 20mg/kg) on pharmacological mouse models of sensorimotor gating measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) using the acoustic startle response test. MK-801, a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, or apomorphine, a non-competitive dopamine receptor agonist, was used to induce PPI deficits. ATM (3 or 10mg/kg, s.c.) significantly attenuated the MK-801-, but not apomorphine-, induced PPI deficits. In contrast to ATM, MPD did not reverse the PPI deficits induced by either MK-801 or apomorphine. Immunostaining revealed that the number of c-Fos-immunopositive cells was increased in the nucleus accumbens following MK-801 treatment, and this was reversed by the administration of ATM (3mg/kg), but not MPD (10mg/kg). However, neither ATM nor MPD reversed the increased number of c-Fos-immunopositive cells in the nucleus accumbens following apomorphine treatment. These results suggest that the attenuating effect of ATM on the increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens induced by MK-801 may be attributed to the PPI deficit-ameliorating effects of ATM and that ATM would be useful to treat sensorimotor gating-related disorders by improving the patient's attention span or cognitive function.
Prefrontal cortical and striatal transcriptional responses to the reinforcing effect of repeated methylphenidate treatment in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, animal model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)	2014	Behav Brain Funct. 2014 May 6;10:17. doi: 10.1186/1744-9081-10-17.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24884696/	"Background: Methylphenidate is the most commonly used stimulant drug for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research has found that methylphenidate is a ""reinforcer"" and that individuals with ADHD also abuse this medication. Nevertheless, the molecular consequences of long-term recreational methylphenidate use or abuse in individuals with ADHD are not yet fully known. Methods: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the most validated and widely used ADHD animal model, were pretreated with methylphenidate (5 mg/kg, i.p.) during their adolescence (post-natal day [PND] 42-48) and tested for subsequent methylphenidate-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration. Thereafter, the differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of representative methylphenidate-treated SHRs, which showed CPP to and self-administration of methylphenidate, were analyzed. Results: Genome-wide transcriptome profiling analyses revealed 30 differentially expressed genes in the PFC, which include transcripts involved in apoptosis (e.g. S100a9, Angptl4, Nfkbia), transcription (Cebpb, Per3), and neuronal plasticity (Homer1, Jam2, Asap1). In contrast, 306 genes were differentially expressed in the striatum and among them, 252 were downregulated. The main functional categories overrepresented among the downregulated genes include those involved in cell adhesion (e.g. Pcdh10, Ctbbd1, Itgb6), positive regulation of apoptosis (Perp, Taf1, Api5), (Notch3, Nsbp1, Sik1), mitochondrion organization (Prps18c, Letm1, Uqcrc2), and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Nedd4, Usp27x, Ube2d2).Conclusion: Together, these changes indicate methylphenidate-induced neurotoxicity, altered synaptic and neuronal plasticity, energy metabolism and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in the brains of methylphenidate-treated SHRs, which showed methylphenidate CPP and self-administration. In addition, these findings may also reflect cognitive impairment associated with chronic methylphenidate use as demonstrated in preclinical studies. Future studies are warranted to determine the clinical significance of the present findings with regard to long-term recreational methylphenidate use or abuse in individuals with ADHD."
Chronic exposure to ethanol of male mice before mating produces attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like phenotype along with epigenetic dysregulation of dopamine transporter expression in mouse offspring	2014	J Neurosci Res. 2014 May;92(5):658-70. doi: 10.1002/jnr.23275.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24510599/	Preconception exposure to EtOH through the paternal route may affect neurobehavioral and developmental features of offspring. This study investigates the effects of paternal exposure to EtOH before conception on the hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity behavior of male offspring in mice. Sire mice were treated with EtOH in a concentration range approximating human binge drinking (0-4 g/kg/day EtOH) for 7 weeks and mated with untreated females mice to produce offspring. EtOH exposure to sire mice induced attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like hyperactive, inattentive, and impulsive behaviors in offspring. As a mechanistic link, both protein and mRNA expression of dopamine transporter (DAT), a key determinant of ADHD-like phenotypes in experimental animals and humans, were significantly decreased by paternal EtOH exposure in cerebral cortex and striatum of offspring mice along with increased methylation of a CpG region of the DAT gene promoter. The increase in methylation of DAT gene promoter was also observed in the sperm of sire mice, suggesting germline changes in the epigenetic methylation signature of DAT gene by EtOH exposure. In addition, the expression of two key regulators of methylation-dependent epigenetic regulation of functional gene expression, namely, MeCP2 and DNMT1, was markedly decreased in offspring cortex and striatum sired by EtOH-exposed mice. These results suggest that preconceptional exposure to EtOH through the paternal route induces behavioral changes in offspring, possibly via epigenetic changes in gene expression, which is essential for the regulation of ADHD-like behaviors.
Effects of ethanol exposure during early pregnancy in hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors and MeCP2 expression in rodent offspring	2013	Neurochem Res. 2013 Mar;38(3):620-31. doi: 10.1007/s11064-012-0960-5. 	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23283698/	Prenatal exposure to alcohol has consistently been associated with adverse effects on neurodevelopment, which is collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Increasing evidence suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol increases the risk of developing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like behavior in human. In this study, we investigated the behavioral effects of prenatal exposure to EtOH in offspring mice and rats focusing on hyperactivity and impulsivity. We also examined changes in dopamine transporter and MeCP2 expression, which may underlie as a key neurobiological and epigenetic determinant in FASD and hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors. Mouse or rat offspring born from dam exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (EtOH group) showed hyper locomotive activity, attention deficit and impulsivity. EtOH group also showed increased dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter level compared to control group in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Prenatal exposure to EtOH also significantly decreased the expression of MeCP2 in both prefrontal cortex and striatum. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to EtOH induces hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive behaviors in rodent offspring that might be related to global epigenetic changes as well as aberration in catecholamine neurotransmitter transporter system.
Oroxylin A improves attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like behaviors in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and inhibits reuptake of dopamine in vitro	2013	Arch Pharm Res. 2013 Jan;36(1):134-40. doi: 10.1007/s12272-013-0009-6.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23371806/	In previous studies we have demonstrated that the γ-aminobutryic acid-A (GABA-A) receptor antagonist oroxylin A has an awakening effect and it also represses ADHD-like behaviors (hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We hypothesized that the effects of oroxylin A were exerted via the GABA-A receptor given the important role of the GABAergic system in ADHD. However, it is possible that aside from the GABAergic system, oroxylin A may influence other systems especially those implicated in ADHD (e.g. DAergic, etc.). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of GABA agonist, or dopamine (DA) antagonist in oroxylin A-induced alleviation of ADHD-like behaviors in SHR. SHR showed inattention and impulsivity as measured by the Y-maze and the electro-foot shock aversive water drinking tests, respectively. Oroxylin A significantly improved these behaviors, furthermore, its effect on SHR impulsivity was attenuated by haloperidol, a DA antagonist, but not by baicalein, an agonist of the GABA-A receptor. In vitro studies showed that oroxylin A inhibited DA uptake similar to methylphenidate, a dopamine transporter blocker, but did not influence norepinephrine uptake unlike atomoxetine, a selective NE reuptake inhibitor. Collectively, the present findings suggest that oroxylin A improves ADHD-like behaviors in SHR via enhancement of DA neurotransmission and not modulation of GABA pathway as previously reported. Importantly, the present study indicates the potential therapeutic value of oroxylin A in the treatment of ADHD.
Effects of Preconceptional Ethanol Consumption on ADHD-Like Symptoms in Sprague-Dawley Rat Offsprings	2012	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2012 Mar;20(2):226-33. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2012.20.2.226.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24116300/	Ethanol exposure during gestational period is related to growth retardation, morphological abnormality, and even in neurological abnormalities including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors on offspring. However, relatively little is known about the effects of maternal ethanol consumption prior to conception on their offspring. In this study, we investi-gated whether maternal ethanol administration during preconceptional phase produces ADHD-like behaviors in the rat offspring. Sprague-Dawley (SD) female rats were administrated ethanol via intragastric intubation with dosing regimen of 6 g/kg daily for 10 consecutive days and treated female rats then mated with non-treated male SD rats after 8 weeks. Another group subjected to the same procedure as those conducted on ethanol treated group except the saline administration instead of ethanol. Offspring was tested for their ADHD-like behaviors using open field test, Y maze test and impulsivity test that is performed in the aversive electronic foot shock paradigm. Offspring of preconceptional ethanol treated (EtOH) group showed hyperlocomotive activity, attention deficit and impulsivity. And reduction of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) level was observed by Western blot in the EtOH group, compared to control (Con) group, while the immunohistochemical analysis exhibited increased expression of norepinephrine transporter (NET) in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that maternal ethanol consumption in the preconceptional phase induces ADHD-like behaviors in offspring that might be related to the abnormal expression of DAT and NET in rat.
A simple behavioral paradigm to measure impulsive behavior in an animal model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of the spontaneously hypertensive rats	2012	Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2012 Jan;20(1):125-31. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2012.20.1.125.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24116285/	Impulsiveness is an important component of many psychiatric disorders including Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although the neurobiological basis of ADHD is unresolved, behavioral tests in animal models have become indispensable tools for improving our understanding of this disorder. In the punishment/extinction paradigm, impulsivity is shown by subjects that persevere with responding despite punishment or unrewarded responses. Exploiting this principle, we developed a new behavioral test that would evaluate impulsivity in the most validated animal model of ADHD of the Spontaneously Hypertensive rat (SHR) as compared with the normotensive "control" strain, the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY). In this paradigm we call the Electro-Foot Shock aversive water Drinking test (EFSDT), water-deprived rats should pass over an electrified quadrant of the EFSDT apparatus to drink water. We reasoned that impulsive animals show increased frequency to drink water even with the presentation of an aversive consequence (electro-shock). Through this assay, we showed that the SHR was more impulsive than the WKY as it demonstrated more "drinking attempts" and drinking frequency. Methylphenidate, the most widely used ADHD medication, significantly reduced drinking frequency of both SHR and WKY in the EFSDT. Thus, the present assay may be considered as another behavioral tool to measure impulsivity in animal disease models, especially in the context of ADHD.
Methylphenidate treatment in the spontaneously hypertensive rat: influence on methylphenidate self-administration and reinstatement in comparison with Wistar rats	2012	"Psychopharmacology (Berl). 2012 May;221(2):217-26. doi: 10.1007/s00213-011-2564-1."	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22086360/	Rationale: Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant given for extended periods of time as a treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The long-term effects of the drug are not yet known, and it is speculated that repeated exposure may produce drug dependence. Objective: To investigate the effects of repeated methylphenidate treatment on methylphenidate self-administration and reinstatement in the most validated animal model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), and Wistar rat, strain representing the "normal" heterogeneous population. Methods: Rats were administered intraperitoneally with saline or methylphenidate (2 mg/kg) for 14 days, prior to experiments. Thereafter, responses for intravenous methylphenidate under the fixed ratio (FR1 and FR3) and progressive ratio (PR) schedules were assessed. Extinction experiments followed, as well as tests to determine the ability of intraperitoneal administration of methylphenidate (2 and 5 mg/kg) to reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behaviors in rats. Results: Previous exposure to methylphenidate enhanced methylphenidate self-administration in Wistar rats but not in SHR (FR3). Methylphenidate pretreatment reduced responding for methylphenidate in SHR but did not affect self-administration behaviors of Wistar rats (PR). Methylphenidate pre-exposure robustly reinstated drug-seeking behaviors in Wistar rats, but not in SHR. Conclusion: The contrasting effects of repeated methylphenidate treatment in methylphenidate self-administration and reinstatement in Wistar and SHR, and the increased susceptibility of the Wistar rat strain to the reinforcing effects of methylphenidate indicate that "normal" individuals are more likely to develop psychological dependence to the drug and experience relapse. Meanwhile, the clinical use of methylphenidate may not produce drug dependence or relapse in ADHD patients.
Methylphenidate self-administration and conditioned place preference in an animal model of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: the spontaneously hypertensive rat	2011	"Behav Pharmacol. 2011 Feb;22(1):31-9. doi: 10.1097/FBP.0b013e328342503a."	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21160423/	The abuse potential of methylphenidate, the most commonly used drug for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has been shown in many studies. However, it is not yet known whether methylphenidate has reinforcing or rewarding effects in any animal model of ADHD. In this study, we investigated whether methylphenidate facilitates self-administration and induces conditioned place preference in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), the most validated animal model of ADHD. We also explored whether the behavioral responses of SHR differ from those of Wistar rats, the strain representing the 'normal' heterogeneous population. ADHD is highly prevalent among adolescents, such that behavioral assays should be conducted in adolescent SHR. In line with this, we carried out conditioned place preference tests in adolescent SHR and Wistar rats and observed strain and age-related differences in behavioral responses to the motivational effects of methylphenidate. Self-administration tests confirmed the reinforcing effect of methylphenidate in SHR, and showed that, in FR2 and FR3 schedules, SHR responded more to methylphenidate infusions than the Wistar rats. In conditioned place preference tests, both strains responded similarly to the rewarding effects of methylphenidate. However, it was found that adolescence also alters the euphorigenic effects of methylphenidate, most especially in SHR. The implications of these findings are discussed.
Reinforcing effects of methamphetamine in an animal model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder--the spontaneously hypertensive rat	2010	"Behav Brain Funct. 2010 Dec 9;6:72. doi: 10.1186/1744-9081-6-72."	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21143898/	Substrains of the Spontaneously Hypertensive rat (SHR), a putative animal model of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), have demonstrated increased sensitivity to many drugs of abuse, including psychostimulants. Therefore, it was suggested that studies in SHR may help elucidate ADHD and comorbidity with substance use disorder (SUD). However, the drug intake profile of the SHR in the most relevant animal model of drug addiction, the self-administration (SA) test, and its response on the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm are not yet determined. In the present study, we employed SA and CPP tests to investigate the reinforcing effects of the psychostimulant methamphetamine in an SHR substrain obtained from Charles River, Japan (SHR/NCrlCrlj). Concurrent tests were also performed in Wistar rats, the strain representing "normal" heterogeneous population. To address if the presence of ADHD behaviors further increases sensitivity to the rewarding effect of methamphetamine during adolescence, a critical period for the onset of drug abuse, CPP tests were especially conducted in adolescent Wistar and SHR/NCrlCrlj. We found that the SHR/NCrlCrlj also acquired methamphetamine SA and CPP, indicating reinforcing effects of methamphetamine in this ADHD animal model. However, we did not observe increased responsiveness of the SHR/NCrlCrlj to methamphetamine in both SA and CPP assays. This indicates that the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine may be similar in strains and that the SHR/NCrlCrlj may not adequately model ADHD and increased sensitivity to methamphetamine.
